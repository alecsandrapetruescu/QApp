#### Deployment setup from a remote to AWS.
##### Requirements
* [Node.js version 16.x](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/#releases)
* [Setting Up Serverless Framework With AWS](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started)
##### Deployment steps
```
# Install the serverless CLI
> npm install -g serverless
> npm install
> npm run build

# Configure serverless with AWS
# AWS requirements:
# Create a IAM user group, afterwards assign AdministratorAccess Policya  /
# Create an IAM user, afterwards assign it to the previously created user group.
# For the newley created user, generate your AWS Access keys for CLI: Access Key and Secrets Key.
> serverless config credentials \
  --provider aws \
  --key your_aws_access_key \
  --secret your_aws_secrets_key

# Deploy the stack to a specific region.
> serverless deploy --region eu-central-1 --verbose

# Upload static files to s3
> serverless syncToS3 --region eu-central-1

# The domain name from the CloudFront will be printed in the console.
> serverless domainInfo --region eu-central-1

# Remove stack
> serverless remove --region eu-central-1 --verbose
```

#### Deployment setup from GitHub to AWS.
* [buildspec.yml](buildspec.yml) file
* [Create and configure your pipeline - from Step 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/tutorials-serverlessrepo-auto-publish.html)
* For the created `Service Role` for `CodeBuild` attach following policies: `AmazonS3FullAccess`, `CloudFrontFullAccess`, `AWSCloudFormationFullAccess`

#### BUG
A Deployment setup from GitHub to AWS with the current [serverless.yml](./serverless.yml) will result in

`504 ERROR`

`The request could not be satisfied.`

`CloudFront attempted to establish a connection with the origin, but either the attempt failed or the origin closed the connection. We can't connect to the server for this app or website at this time. There might be too much traffic or a configuration error. Try again later, or contact the app or website owner.
If you provide content to customers through CloudFront, you can find steps to troubleshoot and help prevent this error by reviewing the CloudFront documentation.`
`
HOTFIX:

* Access https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home?region=eu-central-1#/distributions
* Select your newly created `Distribution`.
* Select the `Origins` Tab.
* Select your origin, for example Origin Name `WebApp`, afterwards select `Edit`.
* In the `Edit origin` page, for the `Origin domain` select from the drop down `bucketName.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`
* Afterwards a prompt will inform you
`This S3 bucket has static web hosting enabled. If you plan to use this distribution as a website, we recommend using the S3 website endpoint rather than the bucket endpoint.`
* Click on `Use website endpoint`
* Afterwards `Save changes`
* The CloudFront Distribution will be redeployed.
